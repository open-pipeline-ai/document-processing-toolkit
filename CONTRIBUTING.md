# Contributing to Document Processing Toolkit

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Some guidelines to help you contribute effectively:

## Communication Style

1. Include screenshots for visual changes (if applicable).
2. Provide a detailed description in your Pull Request—leave nothing ambiguous for the reviewer.
3. Review your code first. Comment on complex or noteworthy code for the reviewer.
4. Maintain clear communication. Whether in an issue or a pull request, keep discussions open and informative.

## Development Setup

Follow the installation instructions in the [README](README.md#for-development), then return here for development workflow guidance.

### Install Pre-commit Hooks

After cloning and installing dependencies, install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
uv tool install pre-commit  # Install pre-commit via uv (first time only)
pre-commit install          # Set up git hooks in this repo
```

This will run code quality checks automatically before each commit.

**After setup, verify everything works:**
```bash
pytest  # Should run (even if no tests yet)
pre-commit run --all-files  # Should pass all hooks
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Our pre-commit hooks enforce:
- Code formatting (ruff-format)
- Linting (ruff with isort)
- YAML/TOML validation
- Trailing whitespace removal
- Consistent line endings
- Checks unfinished merge resolution
- Checks docs

If a hook fails, it will auto-fix when possible. Review the changes and commit again.

To skip hooks temporarily (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify
# or shorthand:
git commit -n -m "your message"
```

## Development Workflow

See [README](README.md#development) for basic testing and code quality commands.

### Advanced Testing

```bash
# Run tests across all Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
nox

# Run specific nox session
nox -s tests
nox -s lint
nox -s coverage
```

### Code Style Standards
- **Line length:** 120 characters
- **Formatter:** ruff-format (Black-compatible)
- **Import sorting:** ruff with isort rules
- **Linter:** ruff
- **Type hints:** Encouraged for public APIs

All style checks run automatically via pre-commit hooks.

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests. Linking to an existing issue is preferred.

### PR Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch from `main`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/issue-number-add-new-thing
   ```

   Branch naming conventions:
   - `feat/` - New features
   - `fix/` - Bug fixes
   - `docs/` - Documentation changes
   - `refactor/` - Code refactoring
   - `test/` - Test additions/changes

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Add tests for new code where applicable
   - Update documentation for API changes
   - Ensure the test suite passes (`pytest`)
   - Resolve any lint warnings (`pre-commit run --all-files`)

3. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add semantic chunking strategy"
   ```

   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format:
   - `feat:` - New features
   - `fix:` - Bug fixes
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `test:` - Test changes
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `chore:` - Miscellaneous maintenance tasks
   - `release:` — Preparing/publishing a specific release

4. **Push your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/issue-number-add-new-thing
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Use the PR template
   - Link to the related issue
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Include test results if applicable
   - Add screenshots for visual changes (if applicable)

6. **Address review feedback:**
   - Make requested changes
   - Push updates to your branch
   - Re-request review when ready

### PR Requirements

- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Code is formatted (Black, isort)
- ✅ No linting errors (Ruff)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks pass
- ✅ Linked to an issue
- ✅ Descriptive PR title following Conventional Commits
- ✅ Documentation updated (if needed)
- ✅ Changelog entry added (using scriv)

### PR Title Examples

- `feat: add PDF document structure extractor`
- `fix: preserve figure captions during PDF extraction`
- `docs: document custom source adapter configuration`
- `test: add PDF structure extraction tests`
- `refactor: separate structure extraction from retrieval chunking`

### Work in Progress

Use GitHub draft pull request feature to indicate ongoing work. This will disable the merge button until the PR is ready for review.

## Changelog Management

This project uses [scriv](https://scriv.readthedocs.io/) for changelog management.

### Adding a Changelog Entry

When making a significant change, create a changelog fragment:

```bash
# Create a new changelog fragment
scriv create

# This creates a file in changelog.d/
# Edit the file to describe your changes
```

**Categories:**
- `Added` - New features
- `Changed` - Changes in existing functionality
- `Deprecated` - Soon-to-be removed features
- `Removed` - Removed features
- `Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `Security` - Security fixes

**Example fragment:**
```markdown
### Added

- Semantic chunking strategy with configurable similarity thresholds

### Fixed

- Token counting edge case in long documents
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

**Run tests with Nox (matches CI environment):**
```bash
nox                    # Run all default sessions (tests + lint)
nox -s tests-3.12      # Run tests on specific Python version
nox -s tests -- -v     # Pass pytest arguments
nox --list             # List all available sessions
```

**For quick iteration during development, you can run pytest directly:**
```bash
pytest                              # Run all tests
pytest tests/test_document.py        # Run specific file
pytest -k "test_pdf"                # Run tests matching pattern
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Mirror the structure of `src/document_processing_toolkit/`
- Name test files with `test_` prefix
  (e.g. `test_document.py`, `test_pdf_adapter.py`)
- Use descriptive test function names
  (e.g. `test_pdf_extractor_preserves_figure_caption`)

### Test Structure
```python
from document_processing_toolkit.models import ContentElement, ElementType


def test_content_element_preserves_type_and_text():
    element = ContentElement(
        type=ElementType.PARAGRAPH,
        text="The PSF model is evaluated using simulated data.",
    )

    assert element.type is ElementType.PARAGRAPH
    assert element.text == "The PSF model is evaluated using simulated data."
```

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Run linting
nox -s lint

# Auto-format code
nox -s format
```
